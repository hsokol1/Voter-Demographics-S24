## 📊 State Demographics & Political Party Control Analysis
This repository contains a multi-part analysis of state demographics, political issue preferences, and legislative control in the U.S.  

## 🔗 Overview
1. **Classification - Demographic Characteristics**: Predictive modeling using state demographic features (income, education, diversity, religiosity).  
2. **Classification - Policy/Issue Preferences**: Predictive modeling using issue-specific variables (e.g., reproductive rights, gun control, climate policy).  
3. **Kendall Tau B Analysis**: Rank correlations between demographics, issues, and legislative control.  
> **Note:** Variables marked with `(S)` are **scale-reversed**, meaning their interpretation is inverted. For example, a Kendall Tau B of `-0.22` actually indicates a positive relationship. This approach allows consistent interpretation across variables without modifying the original dataset.

> **Note:** This dataset was collected during Spring 2024; values may not reflect the current state.

## 🧪 Research Hypotheses
The analysis in this repository is motivated by two primary hypotheses regarding state legislative party control and policy emphasis:

**Hypothesis 1:** If the state legislature is predominantly Republican, there will be a stronger emphasis on **economic cleavages** (e.g., budget priorities, reducing healthcare costs) than on identity-related issues.

**Hypothesis 2:** If the state legislature is predominantly Democratic, there will be a stronger emphasis on **identity cleavages** (e.g., reproductive rights, immigration, gun control) than on economic issues.

> These hypotheses guide both the classification tasks (predicting legislative control from demographics and issue priorities) and the Kendall Tau B correlation analysis. Variables marked `(S)` are scale-reversed to ensure consistent interpretation of directionality.

## 📊 Analysis Workflow
### 1. Classification - Demographics
- Uses state demographic features to predict party control.  
- Includes logistic regression, scaling, train/test split, and model evaluation.
- Visualizes feature importance and model performance.

### 2. Classification - Issues
- Uses issue-specific variables to predict party control and demographics. 
- Highlights relationships between policy priorities and legislative control.

### 3. Kendall Tau B Analysis
- Computes bivariate rank correlations between demographics/issues and legislative control. 
- Includes visualization of correlation heatmaps.
- Variables with `(S)` are **interpreted with scale reversal**

## 🚀 Future Research
Future research could build on this analysis by incorporating additional demographic and institutional factors to better understand their influence on legislative priorities and voter preferences.  

Key suggestions include:  
- **Income Tax Policy:** Examine state-level income tax rates and resolutions, accounting for federal income tax, to explore how economic priorities differ between Democratic and Republican states.  
- **Gender Diversity:** Consider gender representation within both the state population and legislative bodies, particularly the impact of women and women of color on issues such as reproductive rights and healthcare accessibility.  
- **Racial and Ethnic Diversity:** Explore how racial and ethnic composition in the legislature interacts with population demographics to influence policy decisions, including immigration and healthcare policy.  

Incorporating these factors could produce more precise models, refine hypotheses, and help identify both direct and indirect associations between demographics and policy outcomes in state legislatures.
